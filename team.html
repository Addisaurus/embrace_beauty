                            With over 20 years of experience in healthcare and education, the owner of Embrace Beauty brings a one-of-a-kind mix of professionalism, heart, and beauty expertise to everything she does. A former award-winning salon owner, she was proudly voted Best in New Hampshire in 2011 and 2012—proof that passion, skill, and a little sparkle go a long way.
                        </p>
                        <p class="team-member-bio">
                            Before stepping fully into the world of esthetics, she spent years as a middle and high school assistant principal, where she mastered the art of mentorship, confidence-building, and helping people become their best selves (inside and out!). Today, as a licensed esthetician and salon owner, she blends advanced training with a warm, uplifting approach that makes every client feel comfortable, cared for, and confident.
                        </p>
                        <p class="team-member-bio">

                            A multi-talented Licensed Cosmetologist, Esthetician, Makeup Artist, and Instructor with over 10 years of experience—and a whole lot of passion for helping people look and feel their best.

                        </p>
                        <p class="team-member-bio">
                            In the classroom, Carrie Anne brings energy, encouragement, and a big heart, creating a supportive space where students can learn, grow, and shine. When she's not teaching or behind the chair, you'll find her giving back to the community by volunteering her talents at Families in Transition's emergency homeless shelter and a women's substance abuse recovery center.

                        <p class="team-member-bio">
                            And when it's time to have a little fun (and maybe get a little spooky), Carrie Anne can be found painting faces at fairs and festivals, creating characters for Community Theater, or crafting truly terrifying looks at Spookyworld presents Nightmare New England. Beauty by day, special effects by night—she does it all!
